        <h1>GREECE</h1>
        <br>
    <p> During my trip to Greece, we spent the first few days in Athens to see the ruins. Athens is a beautiful city, but you definitely don't need more then a few days there. It is very hot in the summer which makes it difficutl to spend too much time outside. After Athens, we took a quick plane ride to Santorini. Santorini is a beautiful island that consists of Oia and Fira. Both sides overlook the sea and are resting on cliffs, allowing for the most beautiful views of the sunset. There are a variety of different dining options available, with most providing amazing views of the water and sunsets. Santorini is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been and is a great destination if you are looking for a relaxing and beautiful getaway. Mykonos, where we visited next, is another beautiful Greek island but the atmosphere is quite different than Santorini. Mykonos is known to be one of the biggest party islands in the world and attracts a younger crowd. It is still a great place for families to visit, but there are certain parts of the island that will have parties going through the night and well into the morning. Mykonos is a great balance of beautiful sites and party scene, if that's the trip you are looking for. Two places known for day parties are Paradise Beach and Super Paradise Beach. Both are extremely fun and right on the water. Below I've provided a list of different places I would recommend visiting if you travel to Athens, Santorini or Mykonos.
