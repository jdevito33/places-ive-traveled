                 <h2>Welcome to travel tips for how you can see the world!</h2>
            
            <p> Traveling is a very important part of my life. I think it is very important to experience other parts of the world, to learn about other cultures, and to try all the new food! Reasons for traveling include recreation, tourism or vacationing, research travel for the gathering of information, for holiday to visit people, volunteer travel for charity, migration to begin life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and mission trips, business travel, trade, commuting, and other reasons, such as to obtain health care or waging or fleeing war or for the enjoyment of traveling. Travel may occur by human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling, or with vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains and airplanes.

Motives to travel include:

pleasure
relaxation
discovery and exploration,
getting to know other cultures
taking personal time for building interpersonal relationships
