        <h1>ITALY</h1> <!--Paragraph with line breaks-->
        <br>
        <p>I have been lucky enough to spend time in Italy, the country that my family is from. I traveled to Italy with a few friends after college graduation, and we started in Rome, traveled to Sienne, Florence, and then back to Rome. I landed in Rome on a Sunday morning, and my friends were not arriving in Rome until later that night. Since I had never been to Italy before, I had no idea how to get around. I signed up for a day tour which would allow me to see the all the main sites in Rome during the day and I would not get lost. I had to meet the tour group at the Colosseum, which was one of the coolest experiences. You are able to go inside of the Colosseum and see the arena where the gladitor contests would take place thousands of years ago. It was truly a surreal experience. Next we explored the Roman ruins, before taking a lunch break and then meeting at the Spanish steps after. We met at the Spanish steps and then walked to the Fountain of Youth. It was really cool to be able to explore Rome with a group of strangers so I could truly take in all the surroundings. After the tour I was able to meet up with my friends, and the next day we went to the Vatican. The Vatican was another amazing experience and we were able to go into the Sistine Chapel where Michelangelo spent many years painting the ceiling. After Rome we took a train to Sienna, which is an amazing city with amazing food. I truly could not get enough of the food anywhere we went in Italy (not a great trip for anyone trying to avoid carbs). Sienna is a tiny town with so much history and culture. You truly felt like you were part of a big family when you are in Sienna. We also did a day trip to Florence, which might have been the most beautiful Italian city we visited. The Florence Cathedral is one of the most decorated and detailed European cathedral I've ever seen. Below is a list of places I would recommend visiting in Rome, Sienna and Florence.   </p>
