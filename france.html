        <h1>FRANCE</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Despite only having spent a few days in France, Paris is one of my favorite cities in the world. There is a certain "je ne sais quoi" to the city that is incomparable. The city has so many sites and such much history it is hard to see everything in a short trip. Besides the sites, Paris is one of those cities that is so nice and fun to just walk around and take in the Parisian culture. The city is abundant with amazing food, fashion and culture. The Eiffel Tower is obviously one of the main sites to see, and it is even more beautiful and majestic in person. When I went we did wait on line to go to the top of the tower, which was great, but I would not necessarily say it is a must-see if you have a limited amount of time in Paris. You can get great views from the top of the Arc de Triomphe, which is at the end of the Champs Elysees. It is hard to pick just a top few sites that every visitor must see on their first trip to Paris, but I will try my best to provide a consise list below. </p>
